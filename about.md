  headline: WHY WE ARE
  content: Our mission is to help our clients to be happy, profitable organisations
    who have enviable, happy clients themselves.<br><br>The philosophy at Pip is made
    up of two elements; one is about the person we are working with and the other
    is about how we believe we and they should go about their business.<br><br>Our
    belief about the person is that they are made up of a number of individual strengths
    and that in order to develop they simply need to bring to the fore the right strength
    for that situation. We often find that the barrier to someone's success is over-using
    one strength and under-using a better one for that moment. Our role is to help
    the person turn the dials on each, becoming more flexible, effective and happy
    in their role as a result.<br><br>Our business philosophy is that trust is central
    to everything and that earning it can be learnt. The process of building trust
    is made up of mind-sets, habits and skills which are what we train and coach people
    to excel at. Once we have helped with that learning, our client can then use that
    trust to make a greater impact on their client's. This is the essence of good
    selling, account management, consulting and leadership.
